# CDKGlobal Holistic Inventory Refactoring Program
A program I made to make my job easier at one of my previous employers, a car dealership. This program is very specific to my old job and may not work for others.

My job was to insure that every car that was physically present on the font lot had a set of photographs on our website. If the car was not on the lot then it was not ready to get photographed. I previously had the tedious job of walking the lot and doing a phyisical inventory of every car that was out front. I later learned that the Inventory management software that the Used/New Car managers used had the information I needed to know if a car was out front or not. By exporting the data from the website and the management software, I could write a program that checked the two sets of data and output 1 set that mattered to me: A list of all cars out front that needed pictures.

I made it a drag-and-drop program for the sake of convenience, and so that whomever took my place wouldn't have a hard time using it.

The "Simple ReadMe" file contains all the info someone whould need to make the compiled program work. I had to assume an audience that was mostly computer illiterate.
