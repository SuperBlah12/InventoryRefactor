==========
HOW TO USE
==========

Step 1: Get CDKGlobal Data
	Go to CDKGlobal Dealer Command Center: https://login.connectcdk.com/sso/dcc-login. 
	Log In. 
	Go to "Lot Merchandiser".
	Select "View all" under any of the options.
	Select "Export".
	[NOTE: A file should download called "vehicles" or "vehicles.xls". If the file has ANY OTHER NAME the PROGRAM WON'T WORK]
Step 2: Get CDK Drive Data
	Open CDK Drive
	Log in
	Select the Magnifying Glass on the right side.
	Select "Vehicle Search"
		[A window will open on the Left side]
	Make sure all the dropdown boxes say "All"
	Hit "Search" on the left side.
	Click the arrow next to "Export" in the top right.
	Select "Export to CSV"
	Name the file anything.
Step 3: Drag and Drop
	Select BOTH of the files you just made. [vehicles.xls and whatever you named the second one.]
	Drag and drop them onto "Refactor Program" [Both of them, together, at the same time]
Step 4: ALL DONE!
	MissingPics.csv has all the cars that need pictures.
	FullInventory.csv has all the cars.
Step 5: Delete the files you downloaded.
	[You don't need them anymore, and if you keep them they'll just take up space on your computer and make it slower.]
